# challenge1

This document is my first challenge for University of Richmond's Coding Boot Camp.
In this assignment I was asked to ensure that Horiseon's webpage followed accessibilty standards and that it was optimized for search engines. This meant that I had to ensure that CSS & HTML elements were in an organized structure and that each item was in sequential order.
